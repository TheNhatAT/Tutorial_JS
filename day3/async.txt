There are 3 things to focus on:
    1. Producing code: it is code that can take some time to make
    2. Consuming code: it is code that must wait for the result
    3. Promise: it is a object that links producing code and consuming code
    (w3school)

There are 3 state and result in Promise object:
    1. Pending ( đang chờ xử lý ) - undefined
    2. Fulfilled ( đã xong ) - a result value
    3. Rejected ( từ chối ) - ann error object

 async and await:
    - async makes a function return a Promise (Producer)
    - await makes a function wait for a Promise (Consumer)
    -> await is inside async function
