- ES6 import and export syntax:
    1. Named Export: There can be multiple named exports in a single file:
        * Multiple things to export -> use { ... } (all things in curly braces)
        * Note:
            - the name used while exporting has to match the name which is used while importing
    2. Default Exports: There can be only one default export in a single file
        * Use: export default name_thing
        * Note:
            - can use another name to import
- ES6 default parameters
    1. example:
