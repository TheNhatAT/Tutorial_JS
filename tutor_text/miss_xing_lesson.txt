- There are three module types:
    1. Built-in: http, fs (file system), stream, buffer, v.v
        -> just need use: const http = require('http');
    2. 3rd party library
        -> just need use: const mocha = require('mocha');
    3. My own module
        -> just need use: require("./name_js.js")

- How require() work:
    1. Resolve: find absolutely path
    2. Load: load the file (.js)
    3. Wrapper: private scope
    4. Evaluate: VM load the code
    5. Cache:
- Rules of require:
    1. require('fs') => not start with './' or '../'
                        require in core module
                        3rd party in node_modules folder

    2. require('./ || ../') => my own module .js
                            if it is folder -> load index.js

    3. require('folder_name') => in package.json
